## What is the Pomodoro Technique?  
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method where you break work into focused intervals (usually 25 minutes), separated by short breaks. After a few rounds, you take a longer break. The idea is simple but powerful: it helps you stay focused while still giving your brain time to rest.

## Why I Built This  
I’ve been using the Pomodoro Technique for a while now, and honestly, it has made a big difference in how I work. But I always felt like the tools I used were either too complex or didn’t quite fit the way I wanted to work.  

So, I decided to build my own Pomodoro app — mainly for myself. It’s something simple, lightweight, and exactly how I like it. Think of it as a little side project that grew into something I actually use every day.

## About the App  
This app is built with **React**.

The focus here wasn’t on making the fanciest app, but on creating something **useful and personal**. I like the idea of building tools that actually make my daily life better, and this app is exactly that.

That’s it — a small project that makes my day-to-day a little easier, and maybe it can do the same for you too.
